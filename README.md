# DIY-thermometer
I have pretty poor isolation in my room is it can get chilly pretty quick. And even tho I can just buy a room thermometer
I'm getting pretty bored during a lockdown, so I ordered some parts and got to work

## Parts
Arduino uno, 7seg displays, HCF4056BE 7seg drivers and some wires


### Here's how it looks before I solder it all together
